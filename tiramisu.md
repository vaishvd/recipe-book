# Simple tiramisu recipe
## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream (360 ml)
- 8 ounce container mascarpone cheese ,room temperature (225 g)
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar (67 g)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (5 ml)
- 1 1/2 cups cold espresso , prepared (360 ml)
- 3 Tablespoons coffee flavored liqueur (45 ml)
- 1 package Lady Fingers
- Cocoa powder for dusting the top

## Instructions
- Add whipping cream to a mixing bowl and beat on medium speed with electric mixers (or use a stand mixer). Slowly add sugar and vanilla and continue to beat until stiff peaks. Add mascarpone cheese and fold in until combined. Set aside.
- Add coffee and liqueur to a shallow bowl. Dip the lady fingers in the coffee (Don't soak them--just quickly dip them on both sides to get them wet) and lay them in a single layer on the bottom of an 8x8'' or similar size pan.
- Smooth half of the mascarpone mixture over the top. Add another layer of dipped lady fingers. Smooth remaining mascarpone cream over the top.\
- Dust cocoa powder generously over the top (I use a fine mesh strainer to do this). Refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours or up to overnight before serving.
